          <p> 9. After that choose scatter file and also if not set, set your download-agent. You don't need to select auth file as authorization is disabled. Once you do it, it should look like this. ALWAYS MAKE SURE DOWNLOAD ONLY MODE IS SELECTED! DON'T SELECT OTHER MODES! </p>
          <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Make SURE "Download Only" is selected. Don't select ANYTHING ELSE! You will lose your IMEIs, Serial Numbers, Capability of Hardware Attestation etc. if you choose "Format data + Download" make SURE you selected "Download Only".
              <br> <br>
            10. Uncheck oplusreserve2 first. Now, you can start downloading with the button and after that a checkmark will appear. You can reboot your phone and use it like before now! All your userdata will (inevitably) be cleared!
            
            After flashing it should look like this. Download has been complete. Enjoy!</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                1. In case you can access recovery by holding volume and power button (locked bootloaders) - Wipe all data from recovery and reboot
